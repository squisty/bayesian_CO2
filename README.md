# Bayesian Regression using Atmospheric CO2 Data

This project explores the method of Bayesian analysis using R and data from the Mauna Loa Observatory, the relevant data can be found [here](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html). In the analysis, I use Stan to simulate prior model parameters and discuss how the incorporation of data into the model can be used to create a significantly better regression fit. The final 90% confidence intervals for the sampled parameters are no more than 3% of the parameter values, indicating that the Stan sampling performed well. A rendered pdf of the RMarkdown document can be found in the `results` directory.
